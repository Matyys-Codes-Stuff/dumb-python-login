This dumb python login uses Thonny to run better (Will be included)
If you can make it better, copy the whole code and create a repository, then paste the link in the comments.
And it has some stuff in the code like tetris.

The Thonny is from here: https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases/tag/v4.1.6
